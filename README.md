# Overview

The Unity Container (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container. It facilitates building loosely coupled applications and provides developers with the following advantages:

* Simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures and dependencies
* Abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns
* Increased flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container
* Service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container
* Instance and type interception
* Registration by convention

# Roadmap

### [v4.0.1](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/a370e3cd8c0f9aa5f505e896ef5225f42711d361)

Version 4.x is dead. Loss of original signing certificate made it impossible to release anything compatible with v4.0.1 release. To give original developers a credit only about 60 issues were found during two years in production. To move on and enable further development version v5 has been created.

### [v5.x](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/v5.x)

Version 5.x is created as replacement for v4.0.1. Assemblies and namespaces are renamed and refactored but otherwise it is compatible with the original. v5.0.0 release fixes most of the issues found in v4.0.1 and implements several optimizations but the accent was on compatibility and if optimization would break API it was omitted. Once stabilized, this version will enter LTS status and will be patched and fixed for the next few years. There will be no significant development in this line.

### v6.x

This is where all new development will be done. 
The compatibility would not be a driving factor so better performance and functionality could be achieved.

## Documentation

The documentation is a work in progress. Some info is available [here](https://unitycontainer.github.io) but more is coming...
I am a bit busy working on v6.x engine and will not be able to dedicate any time to writing docs any time soon. **I could really use some help with it**. If you feel you could contribute, it would be very welcome.
I've considered an idea of crowd sourcing enough funds to hire a professional editor but this takes tame too, so...
